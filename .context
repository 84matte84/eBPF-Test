# eBPF-Test Project Context

## Business Domain
High-performance packet preprocessing for AI/ML applications requiring real-time network traffic analysis at scale.

## Problem Statement
Traditional userspace packet processing creates CPU bottlenecks and latency issues when handling 10 Gbps traffic loads. AI/ML teams need a preprocessing layer that can:
- Parse packet headers at wire speed
- Extract structured features with microsecond latency
- Free up CPU cores for ML computation
- Provide a simple integration API

## Solution Approach
Leverage XDP (eXpress Data Path) and eBPF to move packet parsing into kernel space, using ring buffers for efficient kernel-userspace communication, with production-ready two-machine testing framework for realistic performance validation.

## Current Implementation Status
**PRODUCTION-READY TWO-MACHINE TESTING FRAMEWORK COMPLETED** (v1.0.0)

The project has been transformed from a single-machine proof-of-concept into a comprehensive, production-ready two-machine testing framework with:
- REST API-based coordination system
- Cross-platform traffic generation
- Comprehensive performance optimization
- Schema-based configuration validation
- Real-time monitoring and profiling
- 150KB+ of production code across 9 files

## Design Decisions

### Technology Choices
- **XDP over DPDK**: Staying within kernel ecosystem for better integration
- **Ring buffers over shared memory**: Leverages BPF infrastructure
- **CO-RE (Compile Once, Run Everywhere)**: For portability across kernel versions
- **libbpf**: Standard library for BPF program management
- **Two-machine architecture**: Real LAN environment for authentic performance validation
- **REST API coordination**: HTTP-based machine-to-machine communication
- **Cross-platform support**: Python-based traffic generation (Linux/Mac/Windows compatible)

### Architecture Principles
- **Production-first approach**: Comprehensive error handling, validation, and monitoring
- **Distributed testing**: Two-machine setup eliminates measurement bias
- **API-driven coordination**: REST API for test synchronization and control
- **Performance optimization**: System-level optimization for high-rate testing
- **Schema validation**: Comprehensive configuration validation with detailed error reporting
- **Modular design**: Reusable components with clear separation of concerns

### Performance Targets
- 10 Gbps sustained throughput in real network conditions
- Microsecond-scale latency per packet under load
- 5Ã— improvement over userspace baseline in LAN environment
- Efficient multi-core scaling with RSS
- Real NIC XDP performance validation
- Sub-second test coordination and synchronization

### Feature Extraction Schema
```c
typedef struct {
    uint32_t src_ip;
    uint32_t dst_ip; 
    uint16_t src_port;
    uint16_t dst_port;
    uint16_t pkt_len;
    uint64_t timestamp;
} feature_t;
```

## Integration Strategy
Provide drop-in module that AI/ML teams can integrate with minimal code changes:
1. Include header file
2. Call attach/poll/detach functions
3. Implement feature processing callback
