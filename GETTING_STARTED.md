# Getting Started with eBPF-Test

**Quick guide to running high-performance packet preprocessing with XDP/eBPF**

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Prerequisites
- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04+ (tested on 24.04)
- **Kernel**: ≥5.10 (check with `uname -r`)
- **Hardware**: x86_64 with 4+ cores
- **Network**: Any network interface (will use loopback for testing)

### 2. Setup Environment
```bash
# Clone/download the project
cd eBPF-Test

# Install dependencies (Ubuntu)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y clang llvm libbpf-dev linux-headers-$(uname -r) \
                    build-essential bpftool python3

# Verify installation
make check-caps
```

### 3. Build Everything
```bash
# Build all components
make all

# Expected output:
# ✅ XDP program compiled: build/xdp_preproc.o
# ✅ Userspace loader compiled: build/xdp_loader  
# ✅ Performance test compiled: build/performance_test
```

### 4. Run Quick Test
```bash
# Test XDP functionality (requires sudo)
sudo ./scripts/test_xdp.sh

# Expected output:
# ✅ 10/10 UDP packets processed successfully
# ✅ Average latency: ~40-100 µs
# ✅ Ring buffer communication working
```

### 5. Performance Comparison
```bash
# Compare baseline vs XDP performance
sudo ./scripts/phase3_benchmark.sh -d 30 -r 1000

# Expected results:
# 🎯 Baseline: ~8% CPU usage at 1000 pps
# 🎯 XDP: ~0.01% CPU usage at 1000 pps  
# 🎯 822× CPU efficiency improvement
```

## 📊 Understanding the Results

### What You'll See

**XDP Test Output**:
```
=== XDP PERFORMANCE STATISTICS ===
  Total packets seen: 156
  UDP packets found: 30
  Features processed: 30
  Avg end-to-end latency: 45.2 µs
  Min latency: 25.1 µs
  Max latency: 78.9 µs
```

**Performance Comparison**:
```
===== BASELINE PERFORMANCE RESULTS =====
  CPU usage: 8.22%
  Average latency: 0.206 µs
  Throughput: 3996 pps

===== XDP PERFORMANCE RESULTS =====  
  CPU usage: 0.01%
  Average latency: 49.015 µs
  Throughput: 1997 pps
```

### Key Insights

1. **XDP appears "slower" in latency** - This is because it measures the complete kernel→userspace pipeline, while baseline only measures userspace processing time

2. **XDP is 822× more CPU efficient** - This is the key advantage that enables high-scale processing

3. **XDP provides consistent performance** - CPU usage remains constant regardless of packet rate

## 🛠️ Available Commands

### Building
```bash
make all              # Build everything
make clean            # Clean build artifacts
make verify           # Verify BPF program loads
```

### Testing
```bash
sudo ./scripts/test_xdp.sh                    # Quick functionality test
sudo ./scripts/phase3_benchmark.sh            # Performance comparison
sudo ./build/performance_test --help          # See all options
```

### Traffic Generation
```bash
python3 scripts/high_rate_traffic.py --preset low     # 100 pps for 10s
python3 scripts/high_rate_traffic.py --preset medium  # 1000 pps for 30s
python3 scripts/high_rate_traffic.py --preset high    # 5000 pps for 60s
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**❌ "Permission denied" when running tests**
```bash
# Solution: Run with sudo (required for XDP)
sudo ./scripts/test_xdp.sh
```

**❌ "clang: command not found"**
```bash
# Solution: Install clang
sudo apt install clang llvm
```

**❌ "No packets processed"**
```bash
# Solution: Check if traffic generator is running
python3 scripts/high_rate_traffic.py --preset low &
sudo timeout 15s ./build/xdp_loader lo build/xdp_preproc.o
```

**❌ "BPF program load failed"**
```bash
# Solution: Check kernel version and BPF support
uname -r                    # Should be ≥5.10
sudo sysctl kernel.bpf_stats_enabled=1
```

### Getting Help

1. **Check system requirements**: `make check-caps`
2. **View detailed logs**: All tests create logs in `results/` folder
3. **Read architecture**: See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for system design
4. **Consult documentation**: Check `docs/` folder for detailed guides
