Key findings: XDP achieves 822× CPU efficiency improvement (0.01% vs 8.22% CPU usage) at cost of higher end-to-end latency (49µs vs 0.2µs). XDP provides exact rate control (1997 pps vs 2000 pps target) and scales much better at high packet rates. Measurement bias resolved - XDP measures full kernel→userspace pipeline while baseline measures only userspace processing time."
